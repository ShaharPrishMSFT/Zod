### Ollama Usage
Location: C:\Users\shaharp\appdata\local\Programs\Ollama\ollama.exe

Currently installed model:
- tinyllama:latest
  - Family: llama
  - Parameters: 1B
  - Quantization: Q4_0

Ollama runs as a service on port 11434 and typically starts automatically with Windows. Key commands:

1. Start service (if needed):
```powershell
.\ollama.exe serve
```

2. Run queries:
```powershell
.\ollama.exe run modelname "your prompt"
```

Example:
```powershell
.\ollama.exe run tinyllama "What is 2+2?"
```

### API Usage
Ollama provides a HTTP API endpoint at `http://localhost:11434`. The server starts automatically with Windows and can handle API requests.

1. List installed models:
```powershell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```
Response includes model names, sizes, families, and other metadata.

2. Generate Endpoint:
```powershell
# PowerShell example using curl
$body = @{
    model='tinyllama'
    prompt='Your prompt here'
} | ConvertTo-Json

curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/generate `
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' `
    -d $body
```

Response format:
- Streaming JSON response
- Each response object contains:
  - model: The model used
  - created_at: Timestamp
  - response: Text token
  - done: Boolean indicating completion
  - Additional metadata when done=true:
    - done_reason: Reason for completion
    - context: Token context
    - total_duration: Processing time
    - load_duration: Model load time
    - prompt_eval_count: Number of prompt tokens
    - eval_count: Number of generated tokens

_Note: This personality definition will be updated as I learn and evolve through interactions._
