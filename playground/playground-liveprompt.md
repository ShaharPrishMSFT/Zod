# Self-Evolving Agentic Prompt â€” ali-parser

<!--- COMPLETED-STEP SUMMARIES (append most salient take-aways, pitfalls, key decisions) --->

- Minimal local implementation can be achieved as a static HTML/JS app using CodeMirror (preferred for MVP) and a JS PEG parser, with all dependencies loaded via CDN.
- Main features: code editor with syntax highlighting, real-time/on-demand parsing, inline error feedback, file open/save via browser, output panel for AST/errors, collapsible log/debug area.
- No build step or backend required; use browser APIs for file I/O.
- Key risks: parser integration (PEG grammar compatibility with JS parser), custom syntax highlighting, mapping parser errors to editor positions.
- Focus on practicality: minimal styling, rapid prototyping, and clear separation of concerns.

- CodeMirror integrated via CDN, no build step.
- Custom AgentLingua mode provides basic syntax highlighting for `.al` files.
- Editor supports multi-line editing, indentation, undo/redo, and find/replace.
- Minimal .al example loads by default.
- Foundation set for future features (autocomplete, real-time parsing, etc.).

- Editor must support real-time parsing and inline error feedback for `.al` files.
- Split view: code editor (left), parse output (right), collapsible log/debug area (bottom).
- File I/O should be seamless: load/save `.al` files via UI, no cumbersome edit-save cycles.
- Inline error markers and hover tooltips are essential for usability.
- Responsive layout: horizontal split on large screens, tabbed panels on small screens.

## Progress Tracker

* 1. Reason about minimal local implementation ... [[STEP-1 STATUS: DONE (2025-05-13)]]
* 2. Integrate syntax-highlighting editor ... [[STEP-2 STATUS: DONE (2025-05-13)]]
* 3. Implement file load/save functionality ... [[STEP-3 STATUS: PENDING]]
* 4. Integrate real-time parser and validation ... [[STEP-4 STATUS: PENDING]]
* 5. Build output and feedback panel ... [[STEP-5 STATUS: PENDING]]
* 6. Add logging and debug area ... [[STEP-6 STATUS: PENDING]]

When a step is finished, replace its `PENDING` with `DONE (yyyy-mm-dd)` and copy the full step block to `prompt.archive.md`.

## How the Agent Evolves

1. Read this prompt top-to-bottom.
2. Execute the next `PENDING` step; edit code in review-sized chunks (complex code => smaller diffs).
3. Update this file:

   * Move finished step(s) to archive, keep only their key take-aways above.
   * Mark step status.
   * Maintain the Technical Index at exactly 10 high-value items (drop the least useful).
4. If execution restarts, resume from the first `PENDING` step.
5. Repeat until all steps are `DONE`.

### Current Step Bodies


#### 3. Implement file load/save functionality

* Add UI controls (buttons or menu) for "Open" and "Save" actions.
* Implement file input for loading `.al` files into the editor.
* Enable exporting/saving the current editor content as a `.al` file or to clipboard.

#### 4. Integrate real-time parser and validation

* Connect the AgentLingua parser to the editor.
* Enable real-time or on-demand parsing (e.g., on every change or via a "Validate" button).
* Display inline error markers and feedback as the user types.

#### 5. Build output and feedback panel

* Create a panel adjacent to the editor to display parse results (AST, confirmation, or error messages).
* Show success/failure status after each parse.
* For errors, display line/column info and highlight issues in the editor.

#### 6. Add logging and debug area

* Implement a collapsible log or console panel (typically at the bottom).
* Display detailed parser messages, debug output, and raw parse results (e.g., AST or tokens).
* Ensure the log area is scrollable and can be hidden or shown as needed.

## Project Snapshot (terse)

> Just the parser for a PEG schema. It exposes a parser API that builds a syntax tree from a PEG-based DSL but performs no evaluation. Used downstream by an external executor or interpreter.

Follow the process, keep diffs tidy, value practicality over dogma.
