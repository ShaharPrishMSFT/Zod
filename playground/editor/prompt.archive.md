#### 5. Implement the tests to the current functionality

* Set up the chosen test framework or manual test checklist.
* Write and organize tests for each UI feature as planned in step 4.
* Run the tests and document results.
* Adjust implementation or tests as needed based on failures or gaps.

#### 2. Integrate syntax-highlighting editor

* Use CodeMirror (preferred for MVP) or Monaco as the code editor.
* Set up AgentLingua `.al` syntax highlighting (custom mode likely required).
* Ensure support for multi-line editing, indentation, undo/redo, and find/replace.
* Configure autocomplete/IntelliSense for AgentLingua keywords and actions.
* Note: Custom mode setup may require additional effort; focus on basic highlighting first, then expand.

#### 3. Implement file load/save functionality

* Add UI controls (buttons or menu) for "Open" and "Save" actions.
* Implement file input for loading `.al` files into the editor.
* Enable exporting/saving the current editor content as a `.al` file or to clipboard.

#### 4. Plan for building tests to test the UI to see that it's working

* Identify which UI features require testing (Open, Save, Copy, editor initialization, status messages).
* Decide on the testing approach: automated browser tests (e.g., Playwright, Cypress) or manual test scripts/checklists.
* Specify test cases for each feature (e.g., file loads into editor, save triggers download, copy updates clipboard, status messages appear).
* Determine how to verify results (file content, clipboard content, UI updates).
