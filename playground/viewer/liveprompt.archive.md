## Step 3: Requirements & Constraints

**Functional Requirements**
- The tool must allow users to load `.al` files via file picker and/or drag-and-drop.
- It must parse `.al` files according to the AgentLingua grammar (see `src/lang/grammar/grammar.peg`).
- It must render a flow diagram showing contexts, functions, rules, and their relationships.
- The diagram must be interactive: support zoom, pan, and node selection (click for details).
- The tool must not provide code editing features.

**Non-Functional Requirements**
- The tool must be easy to use and require no installation or server.
- It should provide fast, responsive interaction even for moderately large `.al` files.
- The UI should be clear, accessible, and developer-friendly.

**Constraints**
- Must be a single HTML file (with embedded JS/CSS) for easy local use.
- No server or build step required; should work by double-clicking or opening in browser.
- No external dependencies unless loaded via CDN (e.g., D3.js, Mermaid, or similar for diagrams).
- Should work in all modern browsers.
- All parsing and rendering must be done client-side.

**Open Questions / Trade-offs**
- Which diagram library to use (D3.js, Mermaid, or other)?
- How to handle very large `.al` files gracefully?
- Accessibility and theming (optional/future).

## Step 2: User Stories / Use Cases

**Main user stories and use cases:**

- As a developer, I want to open an `.al` file in my browser and instantly see its structure as an interactive flow diagram, so I can quickly understand agent logic.
- As a user, I want to load an `.al` file by drag-and-drop or file picker, so I can easily visualize different files without setup.
- As a developer, I want to see nodes for contexts, functions, and rules, with edges showing their relationships, so I can analyze the program's structure and flow.
- As a user, I want to interact with the diagram (zoom, pan, click nodes for details), so I can explore complex agents intuitively.
- As a user, I want the tool to work locally in my browser with no server or installation, so I can use it anywhere.
- (Optional/future) As a user, I want to export the diagram or share a snapshot, so I can document or discuss agent logic with others.

## Step 1: Problem Statement

**Problem Statement:**  
AgentLingua (`.al`) source files define agent logic and structure, but are currently only accessible as codeâ€”making it difficult for developers and users to quickly grasp their flow, relationships, and logic at a glance.

To address this, we will build a local, graphical flow diagram viewer that:
- Allows developers and users to visually inspect `.al` files, seeing contexts, functions, rules, and their relationships as an interactive flow diagram.
- Runs as a single HTML file, easily opened in any browser with no server or build step required.
- Helps users move from code-centric to visual understanding, supporting exploration, learning, and debugging of AgentLingua programs.

This tool will emphasize rapid prototyping and experimentation, with clear documentation of objectives and lessons learned as we iterate.
