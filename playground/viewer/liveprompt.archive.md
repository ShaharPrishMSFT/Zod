## Step 1: Problem Statement

**Problem Statement:**  
AgentLingua (`.al`) source files define agent logic and structure, but are currently only accessible as codeâ€”making it difficult for developers and users to quickly grasp their flow, relationships, and logic at a glance.

To address this, we will build a local, graphical flow diagram viewer that:
- Allows developers and users to visually inspect `.al` files, seeing contexts, functions, rules, and their relationships as an interactive flow diagram.
- Runs as a single HTML file, easily opened in any browser with no server or build step required.
- Helps users move from code-centric to visual understanding, supporting exploration, learning, and debugging of AgentLingua programs.

This tool will emphasize rapid prototyping and experimentation, with clear documentation of objectives and lessons learned as we iterate.
