#### 2. Integrate syntax-highlighting editor

* Use CodeMirror (preferred for MVP) or Monaco as the code editor.
* Set up AgentLingua `.al` syntax highlighting (custom mode likely required).
* Ensure support for multi-line editing, indentation, undo/redo, and find/replace.
* Configure autocomplete/IntelliSense for AgentLingua keywords and actions.
* Note: Custom mode setup may require additional effort; focus on basic highlighting first, then expand.
