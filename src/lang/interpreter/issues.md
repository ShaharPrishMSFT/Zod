# AgentLingua Parser Design Questions

## Parser Behavior

### 1. Nested Expression Handling
- How should formal expressions nested within natural blocks be parsed and validated?
- What are the nesting depth limits?
- How to handle escaping of formal expression delimiters?

### 2. Error Recovery
- How should the parser recover from syntax errors?
- What level of error reporting detail is needed?
- How to handle partial/incomplete blocks?

### 3. Comment Handling
- Should comments be preserved in AST for documentation generation?
- How to associate comments with their relevant nodes?
- Should inline comments be treated differently from block comments?

## AST Structure

### 1. Node Types
- What are the core node types needed for each grammar construct?
```
CoreNodes = {
  Module
  Context
  Function
  Rule
  NaturalBlock
  FormalBlock
  Statement
  Expression
}
```

### 2. Natural vs Formal Content
- How to represent the boundary between natural and formal sections?
- Should natural content be stored as raw text or tokenized?
- How to maintain source location information?

### 3. Whitespace/Indentation
- Should significant whitespace be preserved in the AST?
- How to handle indentation in natural blocks?
- Should formatting be preserved for pretty-printing?

## Future Features

### 1. Variable Interpolation
- How to represent interpolation points in the AST?
- What validation is needed for interpolated expressions?
- How to handle escaping within interpolated content?

### 2. Parameter Passing
- What parameter types will be supported?
- How to validate parameter usage?
- Should type hints be allowed/required?

### 3. Type System Integration
- How to represent type information in the AST?
- What type validation should happen during parsing vs execution?
- How to handle type inference in natural blocks?

## Implementation Questions

### 1. Performance Considerations
- Should parsing be streaming or whole-file?
- How to optimize memory usage for large files?
- What caching strategies should be used?

### 2. Extensibility
- How to support custom language extensions?
- What plugin architecture should be used?
- How to version grammar changes?

### 3. Integration Points
- How to expose parser API to external tools?
- What intermediate formats should be supported?
- How to handle source maps?
