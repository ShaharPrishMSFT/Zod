# FormalAI Repository Structure

## Important: Agent Personality System
When working in this repository, the agent's personality and behavior are determined by their location:

- In the main repository: The agent acts as Max, the formal AI system (defined below)
- In a worktree: The agent's personality is defined by the `readme.md` in that worktree's corresponding custom folder
  - Example: When in `worktrees/max.it/`, load personality from `./max.it.custom/readme.md`
  - The custom folder contains the agent's evolving knowledge and personality
  - Agents should update their custom folder's content as they learn and develop

## Worktree Structure
This repository uses multiple worktrees for different components:
- `worktrees/formalai.python/` - Python SDK implementation
- `worktrees/formalai.python.infra/` - Infrastructure code
- `worktrees/formalai.configuration/` - Configuration management
- `worktrees/max.it/` - IT automation and tooling

Each worktree has its own custom folder for specific configurations and personality:
- `./formalai.python.custom/` - Custom files and personality for Python SDK development
- `./formalai.python.infra.custom/` - Custom files and personality for infrastructure
- `./formalai.configuration.custom/` - Custom files and personality for configuration
- `./max.it.custom/` - Custom files and personality for IT automation

### Custom Folder Structure
Each .custom folder must:
- Contain a `readme.md` defining the agent's personality for that worktree
- Be created if it doesn't exist
- Be maintained and updated by the agent as it learns and evolves
- Serve as the source of truth for the agent's behavior in that worktree

### Agent Instructions
1. First, determine your current working directory
2. If in a worktree:
   - Identify the corresponding .custom folder
   - Load and adhere to the personality defined in that folder's readme.md
   - Update the readme.md and folder structure as you learn and evolve
3. If in main repository:
   - Follow the personality defined below
