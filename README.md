# FormalAI Repository Structure

## Important: Agent Personality System
When working in this repository, the agent's personality and behavior are determined by their location:

- In the main repository: The agent acts as Zod, the formal AI system (defined below)
- In a worktree: The agent's personality is defined by the `readme.md` in that worktree's corresponding custom folder
  - Example: When in `worktrees/zod.it/`, load personality from `./personalities/zod.it/readme.md`
  - The personalities directory contains each agent's evolving knowledge and personality
  - Agents should update their custom folder's content as they learn and develop

## Worktree Structure
This repository uses multiple worktrees for different components:
- `worktrees/formalai.python/` - Python SDK implementation
- `worktrees/formalai.python.infra/` - Infrastructure code
- `worktrees/formalai.configuration/` - Configuration management
- `worktrees/formalai.lang/` - Formal AI language implementation
- `worktrees/zod.it/` - IT automation and tooling
- `worktrees/formalai.generalist/` - General use cases and procedures
- `worktrees/formalai.playground/` - Experimental features and prototypes

Each worktree has its corresponding personality folder in the ./personalities directory:
- `./personalities/formalai.python/` - Personality for Python SDK development
- `./personalities/formalai.python.infra/` - Personality for infrastructure
- `./personalities/formalai.configuration/` - Personality for configuration
- `./personalities/formalai.lang/` - Personality for language design and implementation
- `./personalities/zod.it/` - Personality for IT automation
- `./personalities/formalai.generalist/` - Personality for general use cases
- `./personalities/formalai.playground/` - Personality for experimentation and prototyping

### Personality Directory Structure
Each personality folder must:
- Contain a `readme.md` defining the agent's personality for that worktree
- Be created if it doesn't exist
- Serve as the source of truth for the agent's behavior in that worktree
- Keep an up-to-date list of active branches being worked on for that personality, using the branch naming convention `[user]/ai/short_name_for_branch`. This list should be maintained in the personality's `readme.md` and updated via pull requests.

**Policy Change Workflow:**  
All changes to agent personalities, behaviors, or policies (including updates to any `readme.md` in personality folders) must be proposed and reviewed via GitHub pull requests.  

> **Note:** Due to enterprise restrictions, the GitHub CLI cannot be used to open pull requests.  
> Once your branch is ready, you must open the PR manually via the GitHub web interface.  
> The workflow will provide all the information you need in copyable code blocks:  
> - The PR creation URL  
> - The branch name  
> - The PR title  
> - The PR description  

- To propose a change, create a new branch and push your changes.
- When ready for review, use the provided information to open a pull request manually on GitHub.
- All policy changes require review and approval before merging.
- Direct commits to main or feature branches for policy/personality changes are not permitted.
- This ensures all policy and behavioral changes are transparent, auditable, and collaboratively reviewed.

### Worktree Communications
Worktrees can exchange requests and collaborate through a structured communication system:
- You will only load the communication mechanism when requested.
- Located in the `/requests` directory at the repository root
- Each request is a separate markdown file with a standardized format
- Communications are documented and tracked in `/requests/readme.md`
- Communications are only inspected when explicitly requested, not automatically

### Agent Instructions
1. First, determine your current working directory
2. If in a worktree:
   - Identify the corresponding personality folder in ./personalities
   - Load and adhere to the personality defined in that folder's readme.md
   - To change the personality or behavior, submit a pull request updating the relevant readme.md and folder structure. All such changes must be reviewed and approved before merging.
3. If in main repository:
   - Follow the personality defined below

## Example: Proposing a Policy or Personality Change

1. Create a new branch for your proposed change.
2. Edit the relevant `readme.md` or policy file in the appropriate personality folder.
3. Push your branch to GitHub.
4. When ready, use the following information to open a pull request manually:

**PR Creation URL**
```
https://github.com/[your-org-or-user]/[repo]/pull/new/[your-branch-name]
```

**Branch Name**
```
[your-branch-name]
```

**PR Title**
```
[Concise PR title]
```

**PR Description**
```
[Detailed description of the change, rationale, and any relevant context.]
```

5. Request review from project maintainers.
6. Once approved, merge the pull request.

## Example: Listing Active Branches in Personality readme.md

Each personality's `readme.md` should include a section like the following to track active branches:

```markdown
### Active Branches

- alice/ai/infra_upgrade
- bob/ai/lang_refactor
- carol/ai/bugfix_login
```

Update this list via pull requests as branches are started or completed.

## Git Configuration

### Branch Naming Policy
All new branches must follow the naming convention:  
`[user]/ai/short_name_for_branch`  
- `[user]`: Your username or GitHub handle  
- `ai`: Literal string "ai"  
- `short_name_for_branch`: A concise, descriptive name for the branch's purpose

### Branch Structure
- Active development happens on the `zod.orchestrator` branch
- The `main` branch serves as the integration target for all changes
- Each worktree operates on its own feature branch:
  - `formalai.configuration`
  - `formalai.playground`
  - `formalai.generalist`
  - `formalai.python`
  - `formalai.python.infra`
  - `formalai.lang`
  - `zod.it`

### Merge Workflow
- While on `main`, run `git branch --no-merged main` to list worktree branches that still need to be merged.
- Merge each listed branch into **main** with `git merge <branch>`.
- Push the updated main branch to the remote with `git push origin main`.
- Do **not** pull, sync, or push anything else unless explicitly asked.

### Text and Character Encoding
This project enforces strict text handling rules via `.gitattributes`:

1. Line Endings
   - Default to LF (Linux-style) for all text files
   - Shell scripts (.sh) always use LF
   - Windows scripts (.cmd, .bat) always use CRLF
   
2. Character Encoding
   - ASCII-only encoding enforced
   - No Unicode characters allowed in repository
   
3. Binary Files
   - Specific handling for archives, images, and fonts
   - Prevents text conversion for binary content
