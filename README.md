# FormalAI Language

A formal language specifically designed for AI-centric computing, emphasizing type safety, verification, and explicit AI model interactions.

## Design Goals

1. **Type-Safe AI Interactions**
   - First-class support for AI model operations
   - Static verification of prompt engineering
   - Formal guarantees for AI behavior boundaries

2. **Formal Verification**
   - Built-in proof systems for AI properties
   - Automated reasoning about model capabilities
   - Verifiable safety constraints

3. **AI-Native Features**
   - Uncertainty handling primitives
   - Explicit context management
   - Composable AI operations
   - Resource tracking and optimization

## Development Status

Initial design phase - establishing formal specifications and core language features.

## Getting Started

Development setup and contribution guidelines will be added as the project progresses.

## Formal Specifications

All language features will be formally specified with:
- Context-free grammar
- Type system rules
- Operational semantics
- Safety properties
