# Technical Specification

## Overview
Infrastructure design for abstracting model calling operations in Python.

## Core Components

### Model Abstraction Layer
- Generic interface for model interactions
- Standardized input/output handling
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Asynchronous operation support

### Model Interface
- Common interface for different model types
- Model configuration management
- Request/response standardization
- Rate limiting and quota management

### Infrastructure Features
- Type safety and validation
- Logging and monitoring
- Error reporting
- Performance metrics
