**10 Python Utility Ideas with Embedded LLM Support (Ordered by Complexity)**

These utilities use large language models (LLMs) as helpful assistants during execution. The LLM is essential, but not the core functionality.

---

### 1. Regex Forge

* **Function:** Provides a testbench for trying out regex patterns against example data.
* **LLM Role:** Converts natural-language matching instructions into working regexes and iteratively refines them.

### 2. Config Doc-Maker

* **Function:** Validates YAML/JSON config files and highlights schema violations.
* **LLM Role:** Generates documentation for each key/value pair and suggests corrections or safer defaults.

### 3. Snap-Tune

* **Function:** Benchmarks and analyzes code snippets for performance and clarity.
* **LLM Role:** After profiling, LLM suggests improved versions of code and explains the changes.

### 4. TODO Harvester

* **Function:** Scans codebases for `TODO` and `FIXME` comments and organizes them.
* **LLM Role:** Rewrites TODOs as clear, structured GitHub issues. Clusters similar items using embedding-based similarity.

### 5. Label Sanity Check

* **Function:** Audits CSV datasets for inconsistencies, duplicates, or label errors.
* **LLM Role:** Explains errors and proposes corrections based on the row data and schema.

### 6. Alt-Text Bot

* **Function:** Processes a folder of images and generates metadata (e.g., thumbnails, tags).
* **LLM Role:** Creates natural-language alt-text and captions that evolve in tone/style with project history.

### 7. Shell Sensei

* **Function:** Logs all terminal commands and their outputs in a session file.
* **LLM Role:** Explains each command's effects and suggests intelligent next steps based on command history.

### 8. Inbox-CLI

* **Function:** CLI email triage tool that pulls threads via IMAP and filters by custom rules.
* **LLM Role:** Drafts replies for selected messages and tunes its tone based on your prior writing.

### 9. Incident Scribe

* **Function:** Monitors log output for errors and abnormal behavior.
* **LLM Role:** When an error cluster is detected, it summarizes the timeline and suggests a remediation checklist.

### 10. Meeting Digestor

* **Function:** Transcribes audio from recorded or live meetings.
* **LLM Role:** Builds and updates a running summary and action item list in real-time.

Each utility is designed so that LLM support enhances but does not replace deterministic, testable logic. The LLM contributes interpretation, synthesis, or summarization.
